    # Abstract base class for queue polling strategies.
    #
    # This class defines the interface that all polling strategies must implement
    # to manage queue selection and message flow control in Shoryuken workers.
    # Polling strategies determine which queue to fetch messages from next and
    # how to handle scenarios where queues have no messages available.
    #
    # @abstract Subclass and override {#next_queue}, {#messages_found}, and {#active_queues}
    #   to implement a custom polling strategy.
